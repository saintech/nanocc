# nanocc

## A Nano C Compiller & VM

**nanocc** is port of very primitive "C to custom bytecode" compiller and runner - [rswier/c4][1]. This port is mostly a line-by-line translation from c to go, and is in parity with commit [3f098f3][2].

## Motivation

This project was created to examine the work of the most popular of the simplest C compilers - **c4, "C in four functions"**. The goal is to be as close to the original and as easy as possible to understand.

## Features

The compiler does not support the entire C syntax, only a small part of it. As it is written in the original:

    // char, int, and pointer types
    // if, while, return, and expression statements
    // just enough features to allow self-compilation and a bit more

So, the compiler is able to compile its C version and then itself.

## Differences from c4

 * The most important difference - **nanocc** uses one big byte array as VM memory instead of shared with unsafe pointers in **c4**.
 * Many comments have been added (many of which are translated from [comzyh/c4](https://github.com/comzyh/c4)).
 * Tests. Many C tests sources are taken from [EarlGray/c4](https://github.com/EarlGray/c4) (under GPL-2.0).

## Installing / Getting started

**Via [Go][3]**

```sh
# Download/Update/Instal
$ go get -u github.com/saintech/nanocc
$ cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/saintech/nanocc/testdata

# Usage
$ nanocc
usage: c4 [-s] [-d] file ...

# Compile and run hello.c
$ nanocc hello.c
hello, world
exit(0) cycle = 9

# Compile and run its C version which compile and run hello.c
$ nanocc c4.c hello.c
hello, world
exit(0) cycle = 9
exit(0) cycle = 25983

# Compile and run its C version which compile and run self
# which compile and run hello.c
$ nanocc c4.c c4.c hello.c
hello, world
exit(0) cycle = 9
exit(0) cycle = 25983
exit(0) cycle = 10154153
